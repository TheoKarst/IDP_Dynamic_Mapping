This folder contains two main projects:

1. The folder "IDP - Dynamic Mapping" contains a Unity project used to simulate the dynamic mapping of the environment of a robot using a LIDAR. More information about how to use this project can be found in: "IDP - Dynamic Mapping/Assets/Documentation/README.md"

2. The folder "DynamicMapping" contains a Python project with the same implementation of the mapping algorithms as in Unity. The code can be run using recorded LIDAR captures from Unity, and has a 2D interface using Pygame. More information about how to use this project can be found in "DynamicMapping/README.md"

The whole implementation is also available here: https://github.com/TheoKarst/IDP_Dynamic_Mapping
