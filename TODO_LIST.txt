# TODO LIST:

DONE:
- For the alpha filtering, when building Wipe Shapes, correct the way clamping is implemented
- When fetching model lines from the grid map in the geometry clustering algorithm, make sure to use a set instead of 
    a list, to remove doubles
- Implement the dynamic Kalman Filter !

TODO:
- Implement the cleaning of circles close to lines
- Implement dynamic circles
- Check if there is not an error when computing lines covariances (especially at the beginning, where covariances
have high values)
- Improve the way primitives are extracted
